# The one command for parity runs. It runs the parity harness against the Rust build of the
# commit you have checked out and prints the diffs per backlog group, on one of two lanes:
#
#   wsl  WSL's own Docker, beside the port agents' builds. As many stacks at once as WSL's
#        memory budget allows (~/bin/cargo-slot, parity/budget.sh), so runs of several branches,
#        and the shards of one run, go side by side.
#   box  The test box, LXC 131, one run at a time (parity/lxc131.sh, unchanged).
#
#   parity/run.sh                      # compile here, record, compare with C# 2026.10.05
#   parity/run.sh --only '13-*'        # some corpus files (00-setup always runs; C# recorded again)
#   parity/run.sh --no-build           # same image as last time (corpus or stub changes only)
#   parity/run.sh --bytes              # also the bytes-mode diff
#   parity/run.sh --rust-twice         # also Rust against Rust (the determinism gate)
#   parity/run.sh --csharp-twice       # also C# against C# (after a corpus change)
#   parity/run.sh --csharp-only --csharp-twice   # corpus work: no Rust build or run
#   parity/run.sh --attach             # follow this branch's run again and fetch its reports
#   parity/run.sh --queue              # both lanes: the WSL budget and runs, and the box's queue
#   parity/run.sh --selftest [--sleep S]   # a dry run of the lane's own machinery (no build, no Docker)
#   parity/run.sh --clean              # remove this branch's image and folder (on the lane picked)
#   parity/run.sh --lane wsl|box ...   # pick the lane yourself
#   parity/run.sh --stop-run NAME      # stop the WSL run NAME and its stacks, as its watchdog would
#
# Without --lane it picks WSL when WSL has Docker, and the box when WSL has none, when you ask
# for a box build (--box-build, --low-memory), or when the WSL budget is full with stacks
# already waiting and the box is free. The box lane is parity/lxc131.sh with the same options.
#
# The WSL lane, like the box: commit first (the binary is built from the working tree, the run
# uses HEAD). It compiles octo here as a static musl binary (through cargo-slot), checks HEAD
# out into its own folder (~/.octo-parity/runs/<name>/src, so you can go on working, or switch
# branches, while it runs), copies this script beside it (runs/<name>/run.sh: the run's
# machinery is the script you started, the corpus and parity.py are the commit's) and starts
# the run there detached (setsid nohup): it outlives this script, and this script follows its
# log until it ends, then copies the reports to parity/.run/wsl-<name>/ and exits with the
# run's exit status (0: the run went through, diffs or not; 143: it was stopped). If this
# script is stopped, --attach follows the run again.
#
# The run: the image octo-rust-lane:<name> from Dockerfile's runtime stage around the
# binary; the corpus against the C# image (kept per corpus version and shard plan in
# ~/.octo-parity/cs-cache/, recorded again only when they change) and against the Rust image;
# then the diffs. Every recording is cut into the shards of parity/shards.json (parity.py run
# --shard; one shard, the whole corpus, while there is no such file or parity.py cannot) and
# every shard is a stack of its own, so the shards and the recordings (Rust, Rust again, C#
# again) all go at once as far as the budget allows. Each stack takes a stack's share of the
# budget for its life (a smaller one for the Rust build), and the shards are then joined
# (parity.py merge) into the one recording the diff reads. When parity.py run has
# --waits-from, the Rust recording of a shard waits for the C# one and adapts its waits to it.
#
# Each stack has its own compose project (octo-lane-<name>-<run id>-<recording>-<shard>), its
# own volumes, its own block of host ports from 21000 to 22999, taken for the stack's life
# under a lock (~/.octo-parity/ports/), and its own two networks on subnets that go with that
# block (10.213.<block>.0/24, made before the stack, since Docker's own pools hold only about 30
# networks in all), so stacks never meet. It never touches the box's projects (octo-parity-*),
# other compose projects or networks, or other images.
#
# A memory watchdog runs beside each WSL run (detached too): when WSL's MemAvailable falls
# under 1.5 GB it stops that run, its processes and its stacks, and nothing else. When several
# runs are going, the newest one is stopped first.
#
# Settings (environment): PARITY_NAME (default: the branch name), and for the box lane those
# of parity/lxc131.sh. Every WSL run keeps its things in ~/.octo-parity.
