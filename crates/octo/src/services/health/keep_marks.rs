//! Fixing a set of copies so the best sound ends up in the copy people marked. Navidrome keeps a
//! song's id, and with it every favorite, rating, play and playlist place, for as long as a file
//! stays at the same path. So the copy whose id carries the most marks keeps its path, the
//! best-sounding audio moves onto that path under that copy's own identity tags, and the
//! best-sounding copy's old file goes to the trash. Playlist entries of the copy that went are
//! moved onto the one that stayed, each in its own place, once Navidrome shows the moved song as
//! the same song; when it does not, both copies go back as they were. Every copy a fix removes
//! has its stars, ratings and playlist places carried onto the copy that stays, and putting it
//! back takes them off again. With every rated copy kept, a copy anyone starred or rated is never
//! removed.
