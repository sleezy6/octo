//! The listening log: every completed play of each person, for their Listening page.
//!
//! One file of JSON lines per person under `<config>/listening/` (`<user>.jsonl`): a play per
//! line, and a heart that came after its play was written as a line of its own
//! (`{"heart":...}`) that reading folds into the play. `listening.json` beside them keeps the
//! names as first seen, whether the old radio history was copied in, and the genre answers
//! already found for artists and albums.
//!
//! A play is timed by when the next one starts. Each person's current play waits in memory
//! from its now-playing (or its scrobble) until that person's next play starts, or until its
//! length and ten more minutes pass with nothing new; only then is it written, and only when
//! an app reported it as played. A heart while it waits marks it.
//!
//! Nothing here touches the disk under the lock: the files are written in order by one
//! writer thread, and a person's file is read only the first time their plays are needed.
//! Plays are kept for `Listening:KeepDays`; the daily prune also folds the heart lines in.
//! Nothing is written while `Listening:Enabled` is off.
