//! Family playlists as each person sees them, and the changes each may make.
//!
//! - The owner and every member see every family playlist. Accounts outside the family do not.
//! - An entry waiting for approval is shown only to whoever added it and to approvers.
//! - An entry is served as the library song when it is shared or in the viewer's own library;
//!   otherwise as its outside version, when it has one.
//! - Anyone with `FamilyPlaylistsEdit` adds and removes songs (kids cannot) and makes
//!   playlists. Renaming needs the playlist's creator or `ManageFamily`; the approval switch
//!   (when making a playlist too) and deleting need `ManageFamily`.
//! - In a playlist that needs approval, an addition by someone who cannot approve waits, and
//!   [`PlaylistAddRequests`] is told so the approvers see it.
