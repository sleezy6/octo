//! A pick that only fails on quality (the copy is the same or lower quality than the library's)
//! is asked about rather than refused. So is a pick of the plain song in place of a library file
//! that is another take of it (a live recording, a remix or edit, or a length far from the one
//! most copies of the song have): the file's own title, album and length describe that take, so
//! the plain song is what the copy is held to instead. A copy that is the wrong song, or the
