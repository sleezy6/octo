//! The generated playlists and their state file, `generated-playlists.json`.
//!
//! Genre, decade, year, country and artist mixes built from the listener's own library and
//! served like radio stations: per listener, read-only, under ids that start "og" so they
//! can never be mistaken for a Navidrome playlist. Nothing is written to Navidrome.
//!
//! Year mixes are counted from the same walk of the library as Made for you. Artist mixes are
//! the listener's most played artists, each drawn once a period from the artist's own songs
//! and the library's songs by the artists Last.fm calls similar, and kept on disk as Made for
//! you is.
//!
//! Which mixes exist is decided from counts refreshed every RefreshHours, with hysteresis so a
//! genre sitting at the threshold does not appear and vanish on alternate days. What is in a mix
//! is a seeded draw per listener and period, so it holds still for the period and every client
//! sees the same tracks, then changes. The rules are
//! `octo_core::library::generated_playlist_service`.
//!
//! The Made for you lists (New Releases, Rediscover, Deep Cuts) live here too, on by default and
//! switched apart from the mixes: built in the same refresh, from one walk of the listener's
//! library as they see it, and kept on disk, so opening one never waits on a build. The picking
//! is `octo_core::library::for_you_lists`.
