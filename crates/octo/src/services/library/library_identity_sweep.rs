//! The library tag check: every library song's file is fingerprinted in AcoustID's spare lane,
//! the one recording its audio is gets decided, and its tags are held against that recording
//! (`octo_core::tagging::tag_audit`). What disagrees waits in Library health for a person;
//! stray spaces are taken off here, through the journaled edit path. Its place and every
//! song's answer are kept in `<config>/identity-sweep.json`, so a restart carries on.
