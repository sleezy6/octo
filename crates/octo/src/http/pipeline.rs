//! The assembled application: every route, the catch-all and the middleware (see
//! `crate::middleware` for the order and why).
//!
//! # Registering routes
//!
//! Each feature module exposes `pub fn routes() -> RouteSet` with its templates, in axum
//! syntax and the casing the apps use (matching ignores case and a trailing slash):
//!
//! ```ignore
//! pub fn routes() -> RouteSet {
//!     RouteSet::new()
//!         .subsonic("ping", get(ping).post(ping))           // rest/ping and rest/ping.view
//!         .route("/api/admin/settings", get(get_settings).post(save_settings))
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! and [`app_routes`] merges it. Handlers take `State<AppState>`. A method a route does not list
//! falls through to the catch-all, never a 405, and so does HEAD on a GET route unless the route
//! is registered with `route_with_head`.
